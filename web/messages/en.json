    "q_changeBirthTime": "Can I change my birth time after signing up?",
    "a_changeBirthTime": "Yes. Go to Profile > Edit Profile > Birth Details. Note that changing your birth time will recalculate your entire natal chart and may change your compatibility scores with other users.",
    "q_deleteAccount": "How do I delete my account?",
    "a_deleteAccount": "You can delete your account from Settings > Account > Delete Account in the app, or visit astrodatingapp.com/account/delete. Your data will be permanently removed within 30 days.",
    "q_compatibility": "How is compatibility calculated?",
    "a_compatibility": "We use real synastry — the astrological practice of comparing two birth charts. We analyze aspects between your planets and theirs (conjunctions, trines, squares, etc.) across key relationship houses to generate an overall compatibility score.",
    "q_fewMatches": "Why don't I see many matches?",
    "a_fewMatches": "Try expanding your discovery preferences: increase the distance range, widen the age range, or lower the minimum compatibility threshold. You can also remove specific zodiac sign or element filters.",
    "q_superLike": "What's a super like?",
    "a_superLike": "A super like tells someone you're especially interested. They'll see a star icon on your profile. Free users get 1 super like per day, Celestial users get 5, and Cosmic users get unlimited.",
    "q_manageSub": "How do I manage my subscription?",
    "a_manageSub": "Subscriptions are managed through the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). Go to your device's subscription settings to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel.",

    "a_refund": "Refunds are handled by Apple or Google according to their respective policies. Contact their support for refund requests. AstroDating cannot process refunds directly.",

    "q_block": "How do I block someone?",
    "a_block": "Tap the three-dot menu on their profile or in your chat, then select 'Block'. They won't be able to see your profile or contact you, and they won't be notified.",
    "q_locationShared": "Is my location shared with other users?",
    "a_locationShared": "Only your approximate distance is shown (e.g., '3 miles away'). Your exact coordinates are never visible to other users.",
    "q_birthTime": "Do I need to know my exact birth time?",
    "a_birthTime": "For the most accurate chart, yes. Your birth time determines your rising sign (ascendant) and house placements, which significantly affect compatibility scores. If you don't know your exact time, you can enter an approximate time or select 'Unknown' — but your chart and scores will be less precise.",
    "q_sunVsFull": "What's the difference between sun sign and full chart compatibility?",
    "a_sunVsFull": "Sun sign compatibility only considers one planet. Full chart compatibility (synastry) analyzes all planetary placements, aspects, and house overlays between two charts — giving a much more nuanced and accurate picture of relationship dynamics.",
    "q_personalizedHoroscopes": "Are the horoscopes personalized?",
    "a_personalizedHoroscopes": "Yes. Unlike generic horoscopes based only on your sun sign, our horoscopes are calculated from your full natal chart, including transits to your moon, rising, Venus, and other key placements."
